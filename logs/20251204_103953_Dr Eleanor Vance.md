As you make your way toward Emberhead, you notice a faint glow emerging through the fog—a flicker of warmth and life. Just as you reach the edge of the village, you spot a figure approaching from the shadows. It's a woman, her face illuminated by the dying light. 

"Welcome, traveler!" she calls out with a gentle smile. "I’m May Ledbetter. You look like you could use some help. The inn is closed tonight, but you can stay at my home if you’d like." 

Her demeanor is friendly, yet there's an underlying tension in her eyes that hints at something unsaid. You glance around and see several villagers observing you from a distance, their expressions blank and distant.

Result: **Success**

You respond to May with a warm smile, expressing your gratitude for her offer. She seems reassured by your charm, her posture relaxing slightly.

"Thank you, May. I'd appreciate the hospitality," you say, hoping to ease any tension.

"Wonderful! Follow me, then," she replies, leading you down a narrow path lined with darkened cottages. The air is thick with the scent of smoke, and faint flickers of light dance from behind closed windows. 

As you walk, you can’t shake the feeling that the villagers are watching, their eyes lingering just a moment too long. May opens the door to her modest home, inviting you inside. 

“Make yourself comfortable. I’ll prepare some tea,” she says, her voice warm but edged with something else—perhaps anxiety.

*What would you like to do next?*

[Spot Hidden Check - Normal]
Roll: 6/50
Result: **Success**

You move quietly to the closet, carefully opening the door. Inside, you find several pieces of luggage, all stacked haphazardly. The bags look worn, as if they've been here for some time, and the clothes are hastily folded—several sets of garments belonging to previous travelers, some still with tags attached.

Among the clothes, you notice a small, leather-bound journal peeking out from one of the bags. Its cover is cracked, and it seems to have seen better days. The pages are slightly yellowed, hinting at a history that may be worth exploring.

As you sift through the items, you feel a growing sense of unease. It’s clear that others have stayed here before you, but something feels off about their sudden disappearance.

*What do you wish to do next?*
