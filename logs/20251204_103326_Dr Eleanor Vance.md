## 🎭 Keeper *(Scene: arrival_village)*

[DICE_REQUEST:Luck:normal:85]

As you stand at the edge of the village, the wind shifts slightly, carrying with it the faint scent of smoke and something else—charcoal, perhaps. Just then, you notice a faint flicker of light from a building to your left. 

It seems you might have stumbled upon an opportunity. The building appears to be a general store, and you could investigate it or continue down the main road into the village.

*What will you do next?*

## 🎭 Keeper *(Scene: arrival_village)*

[Luck Check - Normal]
Roll: 82/85
Result: **Success**

You succeed in your attempt.
---

Your luck doesn't favor you this time. As you approach the general store, the door swings open unexpectedly, and you catch a glimpse of a villager inside, their eyes wide with a mix of surprise and caution. They quickly shut the door, leaving you standing in the cold, uncertain of what to do next. 

The village remains eerily quiet, with the murmur of distant voices and the occasional crackle of fire, but no one seems willing to engage with you. You can either try to knock on the store's door again or continue exploring the village.

*What will you do, Dr. Eleanor Vance?*
