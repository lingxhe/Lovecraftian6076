## 🎭 Keeper *(Scene: arrival_village)*

Silas glances at you, his expression anxious. "Just head into the village. There might be someone who can help. They’re friendly enough, but…” His voice trails off, and he hesitates as if trying to decide whether to say more. “Just be careful. Things… things are different here. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”

With that, he turns and walks down the road, leaving you alone at the edge of Emberhead. The atmosphere feels thick and heavy, the distant smell of smoke hanging in the air.

*You stand at the entrance of the village. What do you want to do next?*

## 🎭 Keeper *(Scene: arrival_village)*

[DICE_REQUEST:Spot Hidden:normal:60]

You focus on Silas as he walks away, trying to catch any hints of deception in his demeanor. Although he appears anxious and uneasy, you notice a subtle tension in his posture, as if he’s holding back a deeper fear. His eyes dart around the landscape, and he seems eager to leave rather than genuinely concerned for your safety. 

It becomes clear that he knows more about the village and its customs than he’s willing to share.

## 🎭 Keeper *(Scene: arrival_village)*

[Spot Hidden Check - Normal]
Roll: 43/60
Result: **Success**

You succeed in your attempt.
---

You take a moment to scan the surroundings of Emberhead as Silas departs. The village is eerily quiet, with the faint glow of lights behind closed curtains. You notice a few villagers watching you from a distance, their expressions blank and uninviting. The air is filled with the smell of charcoal, and the faint sound of crackling flames can be heard nearby.

Amidst the stillness, a narrow main road runs through the village, flanked by a few buildings: a general store, a ruined church, a town hall, and a blacksmith. Most doors are shut tight, giving the impression that the village is holding its breath.

[Luck Check - Normal]
Roll: 76/85
Result: **Success**

You feel a strange sense of anticipation as you stand at the edge of the village, but the air is heavy with uncertainty. However, your luck holds; just as you contemplate your next move, a figure approaches from the shadows.

It's a woman with kind eyes and a gentle demeanor. She smiles warmly, though there’s a hint of nervousness in her posture. “Hello there! I’m May Ledbetter. I see you’re new to Emberhead. Are you in need of a place to stay? The inn is closed, but you’re welcome to rest at my home for the night.”

Her offer seems genuine, and the warmth of her voice feels like a small comfort in this unsettling place.
